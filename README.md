# Shortly

Shortly is a simple URL Shortener web application built using Python Flask and SQLite.  
It allows users to convert long URLs into short links and automatically redirects them to the original URL.

This project was developed to learn core Flask concepts such as routing, form handling, database integration, and URL redirection.
